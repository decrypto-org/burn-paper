\begin{theorem}[Correctness]
  The Proof-of-Burn protocol $\Pi$ of Section~\ref{section:construction} is \emph{correct}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  We need to prove that $\forall \kappa, t. \BurnVerify(1^\kappa, t, \GenBurnAddress(1^\kappa, t)) = \textsf{true}$.

  Based on Algorithm~\ref{alg.construction}, $\BurnVerify(1^\kappa, t, \GenBurnAddress(1^\kappa, t)) = \textsf{true}$ if and only if $\GenBurnAddress(1^\kappa, t) = \GenBurnAddress(1^\kappa, t)$, which always holds as $\GenBurnAddress$ is deterministic.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Unspendability]
  If $H$ is modelled as a preimage-resistant hash function, then the protocol $\Pi$ of Section~\ref{section:construction} is \emph{unspendable}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Assume that the protocol $\Pi$ is not unspendable. This means that there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time adversary $\mathcal{A}$ such that:

  \[
    \Pr[\textsc{spend-attack}_{\mathcal{A},
    \Pi}(\kappa) = \textsf{true}] > negl(\kappa)
  \]

  This would imply that the adversary can generate $t$, $m$, $\sigma = (pk, \sigma')$ and $pkh$ such that $\BurnVerify(1^\kappa, t, pkh) = \true \land \SpendVerify(m, \sigma, pkh) = \true$ with non-negligible probability in $\kappa$.

  From the construction we know that $pkh = H_\kappa(t) \xor 1$.

  For $\SpendVerify(m, \sigma, pkh) = \true$, it should be so that $H_\kappa(pk) = pkh = H_\kappa(t) \xor 1$.

  From the preimage resistance of $H_\kappa$ we know that given a $pkh$ a probabilistic polynomial-time adversary should be able to discover an input $pk$ with negligible probability in $\kappa$.
\end{proof}

We note that the security of the signature scheme is not needed to prove unspendability. Were the signature scheme of Bitcoin ever found to be forgeable, the coins burned through our scheme would remain unspendable.

\begin{theorem}[Binding]
  If $H$ is \emph{collision resistant} then the protocol of Section~\ref{section:construction} is \emph{binding}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an arbitrary adversary against $\Pi$.
  We will construct the Collision Resistance adversary $\mathcal{A}^*$ against $H$.

  The collision resistance adversary, illustrated in Algorithm~\ref{alg.collision-resistance-adversary}, calls $\mathcal{A}$ and obtains two outputs, $t$ and $t'$. If $\mathcal{A}$ is successful then $H(t) \xor 1 = H(t') \xor 1$ and therefore $H(t) = H(t')$.

  We thus conclude that $\mathcal{A^*}$ is successful in the \textsf{Collision} game if and only if $\mathcal{A}$ is successful in the \textsf{Bind} game.

  \[
    \Pr[\textsf{Bind}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi} = \true]
    =
    \Pr[\textsf{Collision}_{\mathcal{A}^*,H} = \true]
  \]

  From the collision resistance of $H$ it follows that $\Pr[\textsf{Collision}_{\mathcal{A}^*,H} = 1] < negl(\kappa)$. Therefore,
  $\Pr[\textsf{Bind}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi} = 1] < negl(\kappa)$, so
  the protocol $\Pi$ is binding.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  If $H$ is modelled as a \emph{Random Oracle} and $S = (\Gen, \Sig, \Ver)$ is a \emph{secure signature scheme} then the protocol of Section~\ref{section:construction} is \emph{uncensorable}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an arbitrary adversary against $\Pi$.
  We will construct the Collision Resistance adversary $A^*$ against $H$.

  TODO

  From security of signature scheme, calling $Gen()$ twice will never yield the same $pk$.

  TODO

  \[
    \Pr[\textsf{Bind}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi} = 1]
    <
    \Pr[\textsf{Collision}_{\mathcal{A}^*,H} = 1]
  \]

  From the collision resistance of $H$ it follows that $\Pr[\textsf{Collision}_{\mathcal{A}^*,H} = 1] < negl(\kappa)$. Therefore,
  $\Pr[\textsf{Bind}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi} = 1] < negl(\kappa)$, so
  the protocol $\Pi$ is binding.
\end{proof}
