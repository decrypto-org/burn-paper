\section{Empirical Results}

We provide implementations for the smart contract. In our tests, the following gas results were gathered:

We assume a median gas price of 6.9 gwei, which was gathered at the time of writing. We also assume an Ethereum price of \$170.07. This gives us a gas price of $\$1.173483 * 10^{-6}$.
