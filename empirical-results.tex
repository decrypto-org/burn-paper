In order to evaluate our consumption mechanisms, we implement the federated consumption mechanism in Solidity. We provide a concrete implementation of the \textsf{burn-verifier} contract described in Algorithm~\rref{alg.burn-verifier}. We implement the \textsf{crosschain} parent contract from~\cite{pow-sidechains}. In order to achieve this we implement our own verification methods similar to \rref{alg.is-in-best-chain-federation}. Specifically, we verify transaction data in similarly to \rref{alg.verify-tx} by making use of the open source bitcoin-spv library~\cite{bitcoin-spv-library}. We verify block connection using a Merkle Mountain Range where each leaf corresponds to a block. The leaf stores the Merkle Tree root of the Merkle Tree which collects the transaction id of the transactions included in the block in question.

We put forth a concrete implementation for our burning protocol, specifically the $\BurnVerify$ function of the protocol. Finally, a federation mechanism is used to vote for the MMR checkpoints. The members can then proceed to call the \textsf{vote} method to vote on their MMR computed from the source blockchain.

We release our implementation as open source software under the MIT license.

The implementation is production-ready and fully tested with 100\% code coverage.

Using prices at the time of writing, we obtain a median gas price of $6.9$ gwei and the price of $1$ ETH = $\$170.07$, giving a gas price of $\$1.173483 * 10^{-6}$.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|r|c| }
     \hline
     Method & Gas cost & Equivalent in USD \\
     \hline
     \textsf{vote}                  & 50103 gas  & $\$0.06$ \\
     \hline
     \textsf{submit-event-proof}    & 184550 gas & $\$0.22$ \\
     \textsf{claim}                 & 78267 gas  & $\$0.09$ \\
     Total claim cost               & 262817 gas & $\$0.31$ \\
     \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

For the end user to prove an event and claim his burn, the cost is thus \$0.31. Comparatively, for a Bitcoin transaction to be included in the next block at the time of writing a user would have to spend \$0.77.
