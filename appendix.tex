\section*{Appendix}

Our Appendix is structured as follows. In Appendix~\ref{sec.empirical}
we implement the verification of Bitcoin burns
as an Ethereum smart contract and experimentally measure that the gas costs needed for
verification are as low as standard Bitcoin transaction fees, illustrating
that our scheme is practical. In Appendix~\ref{sec.real} we show how
our scheme can be adopted to the practical implementation details of Bitcoin.
In Appendix~\ref{sec:proofs} we provide the formal definitions and proofs of our
claims. Finally, in Appendix~\ref{sec:standard}
we discuss potential future directions in relaxing the Random Oracle assumption
and propose a scheme for which we show some desirable properties in
the Common Random String model~\cite{STOC:BluFelMic88}.
