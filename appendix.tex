\section*{Appendix}

Our Appendix is structured as follows. In Appendix~\ref{sec.real} we show how
our scheme can be adopted to the practical implementation details of Bitcoin.
In Appendix~\ref{sec:proofs} we provide the formal definitions and proofs of our
claims. Finally, in Appendix~\ref{sec:standard}
we discuss potential future directions in relaxing the Random Oracle assumption
and propose a scheme for which we show some desirable properties
the Common Random String model~\cite{STOC:BluFelMic88}.
