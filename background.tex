We review the definition of computational indistinguishability between two
distributions $X$ and $Y$. Define the cryptographic game illustrated in
Algorithm~\ref{alg.dist-game}.
Computational indistinguishability mandates that no adversary can win the game,
except with negligible probability.

\begin{definition}[Computational indistinguishability]
  Two distribution ensembles $\{X_\kappa\}_{\kappa\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $\{Y_\kappa\}_{\kappa\in\mathbb{N}}$ are
  \emph{computationally indistinguishable}
  if for every probabilistic polynomial-time adversary $\mathcal{A}$,
  there exists a negligible function $\negl$ such that
  $\Pr[\distattack_{\mathcal{A},X,Y}(\kappa) = \true] < \negl$.
\end{definition}
