  When a new cryptocurrency is created, few people have access to its
  economy, as initially cryptocurrency exchanges do not list the new coin,
  making it difficult to obtain. On the flip side, exchanges are unwilling
  to list a cryptocurrency with limited market depth. This creates a
  chicken-and-egg problem.

  We put forth a mechanism for bootstrapping a cryptocurrency by destroying
  capital in legacy cryptocurrencies. We propose that users burn their legacy
  coins by sending them to a specially crafted address which renders them
  unspendable. Upon burning their coins, they can create a proof-of-burn, a
  special string proving that the burn took place, which they can submit to
  the destination blockchain to be rewarded with the corresponding amount.
  Our mechanism exhibits three core properties. First, the coins are provably
  unspendable. Second, it allows users to encode their receiving address in the receiving blockchain
  within their burn in a way that is cryptographically binding. Third, the
  burn transactions are indistinguishable from regular transactions within
  the source blockchain, making them uncensorable. Last, the user can use
  any standard source blockchain wallet to conduct the burn without
  requiring specialized software. We give formal proofs that our scheme
  achieves these properties.

  We adapt previous work to create a mechanism through which the target
  blockchain miners can verify that a burn has occurred in the source blockchain
  without requiring them to monitor it. Finally, we illustrate the feasibility
  of our construction by providing concrete gas costs for the burn verification,
  indicating that our scheme is practical.
