\subsection{The Proof-of-Burn}
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash employ mechanisms for burning money using a specialized
opcode called \textsf{OP\_RETURN}~\cite{bartoletti2017analysis}. Unfortunately,
creating an \text{OP\_RETURN} proof-of-burn transaction is complicated and not
user-friendly. However, it does benefit the Bitcoin network by allowing the UTXO
to be pruned.

As we wish our proof-of-burn mechanism to be user friendly, we propose a
different burn protocol. Our protocol appears in
Algorithm~\ref{alg.construction}.
